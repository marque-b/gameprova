# Timer Fixes and Results Screen Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Timer Not Resetting Between Questions

**Problem**: The timer component wasn't properly resetting when new questions arrived because the `seconds` prop didn't change, so the `useEffect` that resets `remaining` didn't trigger.

**Solution**:

- Added `questionId` prop to the Timer component
- Modified the reset `useEffect` to depend on both `seconds` and `questionId`
- This ensures the timer resets whenever a new question is served

### 2. Timer Discrepancy Between Players

**Problem**: Each player's timer ran independently on the client side, causing desynchronization.

**Solution**:

- The timer is now properly synchronized by resetting when the question changes
- Added detailed debugging to track timer state per question
- The backend controls the timing and question advancement, ensuring all players see the same state

### 3. No Results Screen Transition

**Problem**: When all questions were completed, the game didn't automatically transition to a results screen.

**Solution**:

- Modified `advanceSessionIndex` in the backend to automatically call `endSession` when no more questions are available
- Added `session:finished` event emission in all places where `advanceSessionIndex` is called
- Added `session:finished` event listener in the frontend game store
- Enhanced the Game component to redirect to results when session status becomes "finished"
- Completely redesigned the Results page with comprehensive game statistics

## Enhanced Results Screen

The new Results page includes:

- **Winner section** with trophy and highlighting
- **Complete leaderboard** with rankings and player statistics
- **Game configuration details** (points, timing, bonuses)
- **Game statistics** (total questions, participants, score ranges)
- **Action buttons** to return home or play again

## Testing the Fixes

### To test timer reset:

1. Start a game session with multiple questions
2. Set a short timer (e.g., 10 seconds) in the game rules
3. Watch the console logs to see timer reset messages when questions change
4. Verify the timer starts from the full time for each new question

### To test results screen:

1. Create a session with a limited number of questions (e.g., 3-5 questions)
2. Play through all questions
3. Verify the game automatically redirects to the results screen
4. Check that all player data and statistics are displayed correctly

### To test timer synchronization:

1. Open multiple browser tabs/windows
2. Join the same session with different nicknames
3. Verify all players see the same timer countdown
4. Check that questions advance simultaneously for all players

## Debug Logging

Enable debug logging by setting `VITE_DEBUG_LOGS=true` in the frontend `.env` file and `DEBUG_LOGS=true` in the backend `.env` file.

The logs will show:

- Timer initialization and reset events
- Question changes and timer state updates
- Session status changes
- Event emissions and receptions

## Files Modified

### Frontend:

- `frontend/src/components/Timer.jsx` - Added questionId prop and enhanced debugging
- `frontend/src/pages/Game.jsx` - Added navigation to results and questionId prop
- `frontend/src/pages/Results.jsx` - Complete redesign with comprehensive data display
- `frontend/src/store/useGameStore.js` - Added session:finished event listener

### Backend:

- `backend/src/sessions/sessionStore.js` - Modified advanceSessionIndex to auto-end sessions
- `backend/src/ws.js` - Added session:finished event emission in all advancement scenarios
